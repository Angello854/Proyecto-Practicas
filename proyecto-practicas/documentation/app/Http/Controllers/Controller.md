## Introduction

The `Controller` class is an abstract PHP class that serves as the foundation for all controllers within the application. This file provides a comprehensive overview of the `Controller` class, its purpose, and its role in the system.

## Purpose and Role

The primary purpose of this class is to provide a standardized structure for handling HTTP requests and responses. As an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly; instead, concrete controller classes extend from this base class to inherit its functionality. This allows for a consistent approach to request routing, data processing, and response generation across the application.

## Methods

The `Controller` class defines no methods itself, as it is intended to serve as a starting point for more specific controllers. Concrete controller classes that extend from this abstract class will implement their own custom logic.

**No specific methods are currently defined in this file.**

This documentation provides an overview of the `Controller` class and its purpose within the application. For more information on how to use this class, refer to the [Application Programming Guide](link-to-programming-guide) or contact the development team for assistance.

Note: Since there are no methods implemented in this specific file, I focused on providing an overview of the `Controller` class and its purpose. If concrete controller classes extend from this abstract class with custom logic, those implementations would be documented separately.
