Class Overview
--------------

The `AppServiceProvider` class extends the built-in Laravel service provider, `Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider`. This class provides a central location for registering and bootstrapping application services.

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use App\Models\User;
use App\Observers\UserObserver;
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...
}
```

Register Method
----------------

The `register` method is responsible for registering any application services. In this case, the method is empty and does not register any services.

```php
public function register(): void
{
    //46554
}
```

Boot Method
-------------

The `boot` method is called after all the registered services have been bootstrapped. This method is also currently empty and does not perform any specific actions.

```php
public function boot(): void
{
}
```

Conclusion
----------

In summary, the `AppServiceProvider` class provides a foundation for the application by registering and bootstrapping various services. While the current implementation does not register or bootstrap any services, this documentation aims to provide insight into the role of this file in the system.
