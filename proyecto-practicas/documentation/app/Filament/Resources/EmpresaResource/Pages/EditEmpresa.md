## Introduction

The `EditEmpresa` class is part of the `Filament\Resources\EmpresaResource\Pages` namespace, responsible for handling edits to Empresa records in a PHP application using the Filament framework. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of this file's purpose, functionality, and technical details.

## Purpose and Role

The primary goal of the `EditEmpresa` class is to provide a UI interface for editing Empresa records. This class extends the base `EditRecord` class from Filament, which handles the core functionality of editing a record. The `EditEmpresa` class customizes this behavior by adding specific actions and functionality tailored to the `EmpresaResource` resource.

## Methods

### getHeaderActions()

#### Purpose

This method returns an array of header actions available for the edit page.

#### Parameters

* None

#### Return Value

An array of `Actions\Action` objects, which represent the available header actions.

#### Functionality

The `getHeaderActions()` method returns an array containing a single `Actions\DeleteAction` object. This action allows the user to delete the current Empresa record.

```php
return [
    Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
];
```

### Other Methods (None)

As this class only overrides the `getHeaderActions()` method, there are no other methods to document.

## Technical Details

The `EditEmpresa` class is designed to work seamlessly with the `Filament\Resources\EmpresaResource` resource. By extending the `EditRecord` class, this file inherits the base functionality of editing a record and can customize it as needed.

### Routes

As a Filament page, the `EditEmpresa` class does not directly handle routes. Instead, it relies on Filament's routing system to provide the necessary routes for editing Empresa records.

### Models

The `EditEmpresa` class is tightly coupled with the `EmpresaResource` model, which represents the data entity being edited. This file assumes that the `EmpresaResource` model has the necessary attributes and relationships defined.

## Conclusion

The `EditEmpresa` class provides a customized edit interface for Empresa records using the Filament framework. By understanding its purpose, methods, and technical details, developers can effectively integrate this class into their application and create a seamless user experience.
