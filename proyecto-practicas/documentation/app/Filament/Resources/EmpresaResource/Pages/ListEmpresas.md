This documentation aims to provide an in-depth explanation of the `ListEmpresas` class, its functionality, and how it interacts with other components of the system.

## Header Actions

The `getHeaderActions()` method returns an array of actions that can be performed at the header level. In this case, it includes a single action:

### CreateAction::make()

* Purpose: Allows users to create new empresa records
* Parameters: None
* Return value: None
* Functionality: When invoked, the `CreateAction` opens a modal form for creating a new empresa record

The `getHeaderActions()` method is responsible for defining the actions that can be performed at the header level. In this case, it provides users with the ability to create new empresa records.

```
protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Actions\CreateAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

By providing a comprehensive overview of its functionality and actions, this documentation aims to help developers understand how to effectively utilize this class in their own projects.
