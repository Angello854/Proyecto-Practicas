## Introduction
--------------

The `CreateTarea` class is responsible for handling the creation of new `Tarea` records in the system. This file is part of the `Filament\Resources\TareaResource\Pages` namespace and is used to create a new task assignment.

## handleRecordCreation Method
-----------------------------

### Purpose
---------

The `handleRecordCreation` method is called when a new `Tarea` record is created through the Filament interface. Its purpose is to validate and process the data submitted by the user, creating a new `Tarea` record and associated `AsignaturaTarea` records.

### Parameters
-------------

* `$data`: An array containing the submitted data

### Return Values
-----------------

* A `Model` object representing the created `Tarea` record

### Functionality
---------------

The method starts by retrieving the authenticated user's ID. If no user is logged in, an exception is thrown.

Next, it sets the `alumno_id` field of the submitted data to the current user's ID.

The method then checks if the `asignaturas` field is present and, if so, converts it into an array of asignatura IDs.

Finally, it creates a new `Tarea` record using the submitted data and loops through the `asignaturas` array, creating associated `AsignaturaTarea` records for each asignatura ID. The method returns the created `Tarea` record.

### Code Snippet
----------------

```php
public function handleRecordCreation(array $data): Model
{
    // ...

    foreach ($asignaturas as $asignaturaId) {
        if (!empty($asignaturaId)) {
            AsignaturaTarea::create([
                'tarea_id' => $tarea->id,
                'asignatura_id' => $asignaturaId,
            ]);
        }
    }

    return $tarea;
}
```

## Conclusion
----------

The `CreateTarea` class plays a crucial role in creating new task assignments in the system.
