## Introduction
===============

The `CreateUser` class is a part of the Filament Resources system in our PHP application. It's responsible for creating new user records and handling any associated data creation. This documentation aims to provide an overview of how this class functions and its role within the system.

## Method: `handleRecordCreation`
=============================

The `handleRecordCreation` method is the core functionality of the `CreateUser` class. Its purpose is to create a new user record based on the provided data and handle any subsequent operations necessary for that user's creation.

### Parameters
-------------

* `$data`: An associative array containing the data required to create a new user record.

### Return Value
---------------

* `\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`: The newly created `User` model instance.

### Functionality
----------------

The method begins by creating a new `User` instance using the provided data. If the `rol` field is set to `'alumno'`, it proceeds to create associated records for that user.

1. It creates a new `Tutor` record, linking the newly created `User` to the specified `tutor_docente_id`, `tutor_laboral_id`, and `empresa_id`.
2. It extracts any listed `profesores` from the input data and iterates over them.
3. For each valid `profesorId`, it creates a new `AlumnoProfesor` record linking the user to that professor.

The method returns the newly created `User` instance, which can be used for further processing or updates.

### Code Snippet
----------------

```php
protected function handleRecordCreation(array $data): \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
{
    // ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return $user;
}
```
