# CreateCurso Documentation

[TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the `CreateCurso` class, which is responsible for creating new curriculum records in the system. The `CreateCurso` class is part of the `Filament\Resources\CursoResource\Pages` namespace and extends the `CreateRecord` class from Filament.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this file is to create a new `Curso` record based on the provided data, as well as establish relationships with associated `Asignatura` records through the `CursoAsignatura` table.

### Overview

This documentation will cover the following topics:

* Method overview
* Parameters and return values
* Functionality details
* Technical details

## handleRecordCreation Method

The `handleRecordCreation` method is responsible for creating a new `Curso` record and establishing relationships with associated `Asignatura` records.

### Purpose

This method creates a new `Curso` record based on the provided data, ensuring that any assigned `asignaturas` are properly linked to the newly created course.

### Parameters

* `$data`: An array containing the data for the new `Curso` record, including `asignaturas`.

### Return Values

* `$curso`: The newly created `Curso` object.

### Functionality Details

The method begins by ensuring that the `asignaturas` parameter is always an array. If it's not, it explodes the string into an array using commas as separators. It then unsets the `asignaturas` key in the data array to avoid confusion with other variables.

Next, the method creates a new `Curso` record using the provided data and assigns it to the `$curso` variable.

Finally, the method iterates through each `asignaturaId` in the array and creates a corresponding `CursoAsignatura` record, linking the newly created course to each associated assignment.

## Technical Details

This section provides additional technical information about the code:

* **Code Block**:
```php
foreach ($asignaturas as $asignaturaId) {
    if (!empty($asignaturaId)) {
        CursoAsignatura::create([
            'curso_id' => $curso->id,
            'asignatura_id' => $asignaturaId,
        ]);
    }
}
```
This code block demonstrates the use of a `foreach` loop to iterate through the array of `asignaturas`, creating a new `CursoAsignatura` record for each valid assignment ID.

## Conclusion

The `CreateCurso` class provides a crucial function in the system, enabling the creation of new curriculum records and establishing relationships with associated assignments. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the code's purpose, functionality, and technical details, making it easier for developers to work with and maintain this file.
