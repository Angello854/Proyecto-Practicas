**Introduction**
===============

The `ActivityPolicy` class is a part of the Laravel-based application's security framework. It defines the rules for accessing and manipulating activity log entries. This documentation aims to provide an in-depth explanation of the policy's methods and their functionality.

**viewAny Method**
==================

### Purpose

The `viewAny` method determines whether the authenticated user can view any activity log entries.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can view any activities.

### Functionality

This method checks if the user's role is `Admin`. If it is, the method returns `true`, allowing the user to view all activity log entries. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

```php
public function viewAny(User $user): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

**view Method**
==============

### Purpose

The `view` method determines whether the authenticated user can view a specific activity log entry.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `$activity`: The activity log entry to be viewed.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can view the activity.

### Functionality

This method checks if the user's role is `Admin`. If it is, the method returns `true`, allowing the user to view the specified activity. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

```php
public function view(User $user, Activity $activity): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

**create Method**
================

### Purpose

The `create` method determines whether the authenticated user can create a new activity log entry.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can create an activity.

### Functionality

This method checks if the user's role is `Admin`. If it is, the method returns `true`, allowing the user to create a new activity log entry. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

```php
public function create(User $user): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

**update Method**
================

### Purpose

The `update` method determines whether the authenticated user can update an existing activity log entry.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `$activity`: The activity log entry to be updated.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can update the activity.

### Functionality

This method checks if the user's role is `Admin`. If it is, the method returns `true`, allowing the user to update the specified activity. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

```php
public function update(User $user, Activity $activity): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

**delete Method**
================

### Purpose

The `delete` method determines whether the authenticated user can delete an existing activity log entry.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `$activity`: The activity log entry to be deleted.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can delete the activity.

### Functionality

This method checks if the user's role is `Admin`. If it is, the method returns `true`, allowing the user to delete the specified activity. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

```php
public function delete(User $user, Activity $activity): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

**restore Method**
================

### Purpose

The `restore` method determines whether the authenticated user can restore a deleted activity log entry.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `$activity`: The activity log entry to be restored.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can restore the activity.

### Functionality

This method returns `false`, as restoring deleted activities is not allowed in this policy.

```php
public function restore(User $user, Activity $activity): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

**forceDelete Method**
=====================

### Purpose

The `forceDelete` method determines whether the authenticated user can permanently delete an activity log entry.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The currently authenticated user.
* `$activity`: The activity log entry to be permanently deleted.
* `return`: A boolean value indicating whether the user can force delete the activity.

### Functionality

This method returns `false`, as permanently deleting activities is not allowed in this policy.

```php
public function forceDelete(User $user, Activity $activity): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

By understanding the functionality of these methods, developers can effectively use the `ActivityPolicy` class to control access and manipulation of activity log entries in their Laravel-based application.
