Introduction
============

The TareaPolicy class is a part of the policy management system in our PHP application. This class defines rules for accessing and manipulating tasks (represented by the `Tarea` model) based on the user's role.

viewAny Method
===============

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can view any tasks.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to view any tasks.

### Description:

This method returns `true`, allowing the user to view any tasks, regardless of their role. This is a default behavior that can be overridden in future policy implementations.

view Method
===========

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can view a specific task.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.
* `$tarea`: The `Tarea` model object representing the task to be viewed.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to view the task.

### Description:

Similar to the `viewAny` method, this method also returns `true`, allowing the user to view a specific task. This is another default behavior that can be overridden in future policy implementations.

create Method
=============

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can create new tasks.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to create new tasks.

### Description:

This method returns `true` if the user's role is either Alumno (Student) or Admin, allowing them to create new tasks. If the user's role is different, the method returns `false`, denying access to creating new tasks.

update Method
=============

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can update an existing task.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.
* `$tarea`: The `Tarea` model object representing the task to be updated.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to update the task.

### Description:

Similar to the `create` method, this method also returns `true` if the user's role is either Alumno (Student) or Admin, allowing them to update an existing task. If the user's role is different, the method returns `false`, denying access to updating tasks.

delete Method
=============

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can delete a task.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.
* `$tarea`: The `Tarea` model object representing the task to be deleted.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to delete the task.

### Description:

This method returns `true` if the user's role is either Alumno (Student) or Admin, allowing them to delete a task. If the user's role is different, the method returns `false`, denying access to deleting tasks.

restore Method
==============

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can restore a deleted task.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.
* `$tarea`: The `Tarea` model object representing the task to be restored.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to restore the task.

### Description:

This method returns `false`, denying access to restoring tasks. This is because, in our system, only administrators are allowed to perform this operation.

forceDelete Method
================

### Purpose:

This method determines whether the authenticated user can permanently delete a task.

### Parameters:

* `$user`: The authenticated user object.
* `$tarea`: The `Tarea` model object representing the task to be permanently deleted.

### Return Value:

A boolean indicating whether the user has permission to permanently delete the task.

### Description:

This method returns `false`, denying access to permanently deleting tasks. This is because, in our system, only administrators are allowed to perform this operation.

By following these policy rules, we ensure that users can only access and manipulate tasks according to their roles, maintaining data integrity and security within our application.
