Introduction:
------------

The `TitulacionPolicy` class is responsible for defining the access control rules for the `Titulacion` model in our application. This policy determines whether a user can perform various actions on titulación records, such as viewing, creating, updating, deleting, restoring, or permanently deleting them.

viewAny Method:
-------------

### Purpose

The `viewAny` method checks if a user has permission to view any titulación records.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can view any titulación records

### Functionality

This method returns `true` if the user's role is either Tutor Docente or Admin. This means that users with these roles have permission to view all existing titulación records.

```php
public function viewAny(User $user): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::TutorDocente ||  getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

view Method:
------------

### Purpose

The `view` method checks if a user has permission to view a specific titulación record.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `$titulacion`: The titulación record being viewed
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can view the record

### Functionality

This method returns `true` if the user's role is either Tutor Docente or Admin, similar to the `viewAny` method. This means that users with these roles have permission to view any individual titulación records.

```php
public function view(User $user, Titulacion $titulacion): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::TutorDocente ||  getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

create Method:
--------------

### Purpose

The `create` method checks if a user has permission to create new titulación records.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can create new records

### Functionality

This method returns `true` only if the user's role is Admin. This means that users with this role have permission to create new titulación records.

```php
public function create(User $user): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

update Method:
--------------

### Purpose

The `update` method checks if a user has permission to update existing titulación records.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `$titulacion`: The titulación record being updated
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can update the record

### Functionality

This method returns `true` if the user's role is either Tutor Docente or Admin. This means that users with these roles have permission to update any individual titulación records.

```php
public function update(User $user, Titulacion $titulacion): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::TutorDocente ||  getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

delete Method:
--------------

### Purpose

The `delete` method checks if a user has permission to delete existing titulación records.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `$titulacion`: The titulación record being deleted
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can delete the record

### Functionality

This method returns `true` only if the user's role is Admin. This means that users with this role have permission to delete any individual titulación records.

```php
public function delete(User $user, Titulacion $titulacion): bool
{
    return getUserRol() === Rol::Admin;
}
```

restore Method:
--------------

### Purpose

The `restore` method checks if a user has permission to restore deleted titulación records.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `$titulacion`: The titulación record being restored
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can restore the record

### Functionality

This method returns `false` for all users. This means that no user has permission to restore deleted titulación records.

```php
public function restore(User $user, Titulacion $titulacion): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

forceDelete Method:
-----------------

### Purpose

The `forceDelete` method checks if a user has permission to permanently delete titulación records.

### Parameters and Return Value

* `$user`: The authenticated user object
* `$titulacion`: The titulación record being permanently deleted
* `Return value`: A boolean indicating whether the user can permanently delete the record

### Functionality

This method returns `false` for all users. This means that no user has permission to permanently delete titulación records.

```php
public function forceDelete(User $user, Titulacion $titulacion): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

Conclusion:
----------

The `TitulacionPolicy` class provides a set of rules and constraints for managing titulación records in our application. These methods determine whether users with different roles can perform various actions on these records, ensuring the integrity and security of the data.
