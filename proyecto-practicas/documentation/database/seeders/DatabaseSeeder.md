Introduction
------------

The `DatabaseSeeder` class is responsible for seeding the application's database with test data. This process helps ensure that the database is properly initialized and populated with relevant information.

Methods
--------

### run Method
---------------

The `run` method is the entry point of the `DatabaseSeeder` class. Its purpose is to seed the database with test data. The method accepts no parameters and returns void.

```php
public function run(): void
{
    // User::factory(10)->create();

    User::factory()->create([
        'name' => 'Test User',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ]);
}
```

In this example, the `run` method creates a single user in the database with a specific name and email address. The `User::factory()` method is used to generate a new user instance, and the `create` method is used to persist it in the database.

Technical Details
-----------------

The `run` method uses the `User::factory()` method to generate a new user instance. This method returns an instance of the `UserFactory` class, which provides a convenient way to create fake data for testing purposes.

The `create` method is then used to persist the generated user instance in the database. This method accepts an array of attributes as its second argument, which are used to populate the corresponding columns in the database table.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the `DatabaseSeeder` class provides a simple and efficient way to seed the application's database with test data. The `run` method is the entry point of the class, and it uses the `User::factory()` and `create` methods to generate and persist new user instances in the database.

By following this documentation, developers should have a good understanding of how the code works and why it exists.
