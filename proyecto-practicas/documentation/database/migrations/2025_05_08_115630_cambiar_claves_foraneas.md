### Introduction

The `cambiar_claves_foraneas.php` migration file is responsible for updating the relationships between foreign key constraints in the `tutores` table. This file is part of a larger Laravel application that manages academic and professional practices.

### Up Method

#### Purpose

The `up()` method is called when the migration is executed to update or create database tables. In this case, it updates the foreign key constraints in the `tutores` table to reference the correct tables (`users` and `empresas`) and set null on delete.

#### Parameters and Return Values

* No parameters are required for this method.
* This method does not return any values.

#### Functionality

The `up()` method performs the following steps:

1. Drops the existing foreign key constraints:
	+ `tutor_docente_id`
	+ `tutor_laboral_id`
	+ `empresa_id`
2. Creates new foreign key constraints:
	+ `tutor_docente_id` references the `id` column in the `users` table and sets null on delete.
	+ `tutor_laboral_id` references the `id` column in the `users` table and sets null on delete.
	+ `empresa_id` references the `id` column in the `empresas` table and sets null on delete.

```php
Schema::table('tutores', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // ...
});
```

### Down Method

#### Purpose

The `down()` method is called when the migration is rolled back or undone. In this case, it does not perform any operations to reverse the changes made in the `up()` method.

#### Parameters and Return Values

* No parameters are required for this method.
* This method does not return any values.

#### Functionality

The `down()` method does nothing because there is no need to reverse the changes made in the `up()` method. The relationships between foreign key constraints have been updated, and rolling back the migration would not restore the original state.

### Conclusion

This migration file updates the foreign key constraints in the `tutores` table to reference the correct tables (`users` and `empresas`) and set null on delete. The `up()` method performs the necessary database operations to achieve this, while the `down()` method does not perform any operations because there is no need to reverse the changes made in the `up()` method.
