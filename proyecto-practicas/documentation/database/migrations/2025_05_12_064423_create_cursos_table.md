## Introduction
-------------

The `CreateCursosTable` migration is responsible for creating the `cursos` table in the database. This file is part of a larger PHP codebase that utilizes the Laravel framework.

### Purpose
----------

This migration's primary goal is to create a new table called `cursos`. The purpose of this table is to store information about courses, such as their names and associated subject IDs (in JSON format). The migration also includes timestamp columns for recording when each course was created or updated.

## Methods
---------

### Up
------------

The `up` method is responsible for creating the `cursos` table. It takes no parameters and returns void.

```php
public function up(): void
{
    Schema::create('cursos', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('nombre');
        $table->json('asignatura_id')->nullable();
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

This method uses the `Schema` facade to create a new table called `cursos`. The table has four columns:

*   `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key.
*   `nombre`: A string column for storing course names.
*   `asignatura_id`: A JSON column (nullable) for storing subject IDs. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of related data.
*   `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamp columns for recording when each course was created or updated.

### Down
------------

The `down` method is responsible for reversing the migrations, i.e., dropping the `cursos` table. It also takes no parameters and returns void.

```php
public function down(): void
{
    Schema::dropIfExists('cursos');
}
```

This method uses the `Schema` facade to drop (or reverse) the creation of the `cursos` table, effectively deleting all rows in the table.

## Conclusion
----------

The `CreateCursosTable` migration is a crucial part of our Laravel-based application. Its purpose is to create and manage the `cursos` table, allowing us to store information about courses and their associated subject IDs. This documentation should provide a comprehensive understanding of how this code works and its role in the larger system.
