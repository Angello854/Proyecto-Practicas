Introduction
------------

This PHP file is a migration script for Laravel, used to delete two tables: `tutores_laborales` and `tutores_docentes`. The purpose of this migration is to remove these tables from the database.

up Method
----------

### Purpose

The `up` method is responsible for executing the necessary database operations to complete the deletion process. This includes dropping the foreign keys related to the deleted tables, followed by deleting the tables themselves.

### Functionality

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what this method does:

1. `$table->dropForeign(['tutor_docente_id'])`, `$table->dropForeign(['tutor_laboral_id'])`, and `$table->dropForeign(['empresa_id'])` drop the foreign keys related to the `alumnos` table.
2. `Schema::dropIfExists('tutores_laborales')` and `Schema::dropIfExists('tutores_docentes')` delete the `tutores_laborales` and `tutores_docentes` tables from the database.

```php
public function up(): void
{
    Schema::table('alumnos', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->dropForeign(['tutor_docente_id']);
        $table->dropForeign(['tutor_laboral_id']);
        $table->dropForeign(['empresa_id']);
    });
    Schema::dropIfExists('tutores_laborales');
    Schema::dropIfExists('tutores_docentes');
}
```

down Method
------------

### Purpose (Down)

The `down` method is responsible for reverting the changes made by the `up` method. However, since there's no specific functionality required for this migration, the `down` method is left empty.

```php
public function down(): void
{
    // No-op
}
```

In summary, this PHP file contains a single class that extends Laravel's built-in `Migration` class. The `up` method executes a series of database operations to delete two tables and their related foreign keys, while the `down` method does nothing since there's no need for reverting these changes.

Note: This documentation provides an overview of the code's functionality and purpose. It is intended for developers who will be working with or maintaining this codebase.
