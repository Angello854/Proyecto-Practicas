**Introduction**

The `2025_05_08_121351_update_tutores_nullable_columns.php` file contains a database migration that updates the nullable columns for the `tutores` table. This migration is part of a larger effort to improve data integrity and reduce errors in our application.

**Migration Method: `up()`**

### Description

The `up()` method is responsible for executing the necessary changes to update the `tutores` table. This method creates and modifies database tables, columns, and relationships as needed.

### Parameters and Return Values

* None

### Functionality

The `up()` method starts by dropping foreign key constraints on the `tutor_docente_id`, `tutor_laboral_id`, and `empresa_id` columns in the `tutores` table. Then, it updates these columns to be nullable, allowing for more flexibility when working with this data.

Next, the method creates new foreign key constraints that reference the `id` column of the `users` and `empresas` tables, respectively. These constraints ensure that the `tutor_docente_id`, `tutor_laboral_id`, and `empresa_id` columns in the `tutores` table are properly linked to their respective parent tables.

**Reverse Migration Method: `down()`**

### Description

The `down()` method is responsible for reverting the changes made by the `up()` method. This method undoes any modifications or additions made to the database tables, columns, and relationships.

### Parameters and Return Values

* None

### Functionality

The `down()` method does not currently contain any functionality, as this migration is intended to be a one-way operation that cannot be easily reversed. However, if a need arises in the future to reverse this migration, this section would provide the necessary code to do so.

Note: This documentation assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of PHP and Laravel's database migration framework.
