## Introduction

The `CreateTareasTable` file is a part of the database migration system in this PHP application. Its purpose is to create and manage the `tareas` table, which stores information about tasks or assignments.

This documentation will focus on the methods and functionality implemented in this file.

## Method: up()

### Purpose

The `up()` method is called when a new migration is executed. It creates the `tareas` table with specified columns and data types.

### Parameters and Return Values

None.

### Functionality

The `up()` method uses the `Schema::create()` function to create the `tareas` table. The table has the following columns:

* `id`: A unique identifier for each task.
* `descripcion`: A string column to store the task description.
* `fecha`: A date column to record the due date.
* `asignatura`: A JSON column (nullable) to store the subject or topic of the task.
* `aprendizaje` and `refuerzo`: String columns (nullable) to store additional information about the learning process.
* `horas`: An unsigned tiny integer column to record the number of hours spent on the task.
* `materiales`: An enum column with possible values 'equipo propio' or 'ordenador empresa' to indicate the materials used for the task.
* `comentarios`: A text column (nullable) to store any additional comments about the task.
* `timestamps`: Two timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) to track when the record was created and last updated.

### Code Snippet

```php
Schema::create('tareas', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // ...
});
```

## Method: down()

### Purpose

The `down()` method is called when a migration is rolled back. Its purpose is to reverse the changes made by the `up()` method, in this case, dropping the `tareas` table.

### Parameters and Return Values

None.

### Functionality

The `down()` method uses the `Schema::dropIfExists()` function to drop the `tareas` table.

### Code Snippet

```php
Schema::dropIfExists('tareas');
```
