Introduction
=============

This migration script, `2025_05_12_100132_add_tutor_docente_id_to_tutores_table_2`, is designed to add a foreign key column named `tutor_docente_id` to the `tutores` table. This change enables relationships between tutors and their corresponding teaching assistants.

Migration Methodology
=====================

The migration is based on Laravel's built-in migration functionality, which allows for database schema changes to be managed through a series of migrations. The script extends the `Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration` class and defines two methods: `up()` and `down()`.

Up Method
==========

### Purpose

The purpose of this method is to execute the necessary SQL statements to add the foreign key column `tutor_docente_id` to the `tutores` table. This operation allows for the establishment of relationships between tutors and their corresponding teaching assistants in the database.

### Parameters and Return Values

* No parameters are required or returned by this method.

### Functionality

The script uses Laravel's Schema facade to interact with the database. It specifies that the foreign key column `tutor_docente_id` should be added to the `tutores` table, making it nullable and constrained to the `users` table. The `onDelete('cascade')` statement ensures that if a related record is deleted from the `users` table, the corresponding records in the `tutores` table are also deleted.

```php
Schema::table('tutores', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->foreignId('tutor_docente_id')
        ->nullable()
        ->constrained('users')
        ->onDelete('cascade');
});
```

Down Method
 ==========

### Purpose

The purpose of this method is to reverse the migration, removing the foreign key column `tutor_docente_id` from the `tutores` table.

### Parameters and Return Values

* No parameters are required or returned by this method.

### Functionality

This method does not execute any SQL statements. The intention is to leave the database schema unchanged, effectively rolling back the changes made during the up method.
