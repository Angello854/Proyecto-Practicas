## Introduction
The `CreateAlumnosTable` migration is a PHP file responsible for creating the `alumnos` table in the database. This table will store information about students, including their name, surnames, email, and phone number.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this migration is to create the necessary structure for storing student data in the database.

## Migration-Methods

### Up Method
#### Purpose
The `up` method is responsible for creating the `alumnos` table in the database.

#### Parameters
* None

#### Return Values
* Void

#### Functionality
This method uses the `Schema::create` function to create a new table named `alumnos`. The table has the following columns:
	+ `id`: A unique identifier for each student.
	+ `nombre`: The student's name.
	+ `apellidos`: The student's surnames (optional).
	+ `email`: The student's email address (optional).
	+ `telefono`: The student's phone number (optional).
	+ `timestamps`: A timestamp representing the date and time of creation or modification.

The `up` method uses a `Blueprint` object to define the table structure. The `id`, `nombre`, `apellidos`, `email`, and `telefono` columns are created with default settings, while the `timestamps` column is set to automatically generate timestamps for creation and modification.

### Down Method
#### Purpose
The `down` method is responsible for reversing the changes made by the `up` method. In this case, it drops the `alumnos` table from the database.

#### Parameters
* None

#### Return Values
* Void

#### Functionality
This method uses the `Schema::dropIfExists` function to drop the `alumnos` table from the database. This reverses the changes made by the `up` method, effectively removing the table and its data.

## Conclusion
The `CreateAlumnosTable` migration is a crucial part of the application's database setup process. It creates the necessary structure for storing student data and provides a foundation for future development and maintenance.
