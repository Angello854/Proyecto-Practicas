Introduction
------------

The `modify_rol_column_in_users_table` migration is responsible for modifying the `rol` column in the `users` table. This file is part of a larger database migration process that updates the schema of a Laravel application.

Migration Methodology
-------------------

### Up Method
```
public function up(): void
{
    Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->string('rol')->change();
    });
}
```

The `up` method is responsible for making the changes to the database schema. In this case, it modifies the `rol` column in the `users` table by changing its type from an existing type to a string.

### Down Method
```
public function down(): void
{
    Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        //
    });
}
```

The `down` method is responsible for reverting any changes made in the `up` method. In this case, it does not make any changes because the modification to the `rol` column is intended to be permanent.

Technical Details
-----------------

* The migration uses the `Schema::table` method to modify the `users` table.
* The `$table->string('rol')->change()` statement modifies the `rol` column by changing its type from an existing type to a string.
