## Introduction
The `2025_05_12_093444_create_asignatura_tutor_docente` file is a migration script that creates the `asignatura_tutor_docente` table in the database. This table establishes a relationship between the `asignaturas` and `tutor_docentes` tables.

### Purpose
The purpose of this migration script is to create a new table that stores the relationships between tutors and teaching staff assigned to specific subjects (asignaturas). This allows for efficient querying and management of these assignments.

## Table Creation

### `up()` Method
The `up()` method executes when the migration is applied. It creates the `asignatura_tutor_docente` table with the following columns:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | Primary key |
| asignatura_id | foreignId | Foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `asignaturas` table. The `onDelete('cascade')` constraint ensures that when an asignatura is deleted, all related records in this table are also deleted. |
| tutor_docente_id | foreignId | Foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `tutor_docentes` table (or users table). The `onDelete('cascade')` constraint ensures that when a tutor docente is deleted, all related records in this table are also deleted. |
| timestamps | timestamp | Created and updated at timestamps |

### `down()` Method
The `down()` method executes when the migration is reverted. It drops the `asignatura_tutor_docente` table.

## Technical Details

This migration script uses Laravel's Eloquent schema builder to create the table. The `foreignId` column type is used to establish relationships with other tables, and the `timestamps` column is automatically created by the schema builder to track creation and update times.

## Conclusion
The `2025_05_12_093444_create_asignatura_tutor_docente` migration script creates a table that facilitates the management of asignaturas and tutor docentes. This documentation provides an overview of the script's purpose, functionality, and technical details, making it easier for developers to understand and use this code.
