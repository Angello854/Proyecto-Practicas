## Introduction
===============

The `2025_05_13_071140_recreate_alumno_profesor_table` migration is a part of the database migrations in a PHP application. Its primary purpose is to recreate the `alumno_profesor` table, establishing relationships with the `users` table.

## Migration Purpose
=====================

This migration aims to update the existing database schema by dropping and recreating the `alumno_tutor-docente` and `alumno_profesor` tables. The main goal is to establish a new relationship between `alumnos` (students) and `profesores` (teachers).

### Up Method
=============

#### Description
---------------

The `up()` method is responsible for executing the migration's logic when upgrading the database schema.

#### Functionality
-----------------

The `up()` method performs the following tasks:

1. Drops any existing `alumno_tutor-docente` and `alumno_profesor` tables.
2. Creates a new `alumno_profesor` table with the following columns:
	* `id`: A primary key (auto-incrementing integer).
	* `alumno_id`: A foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `users` table, establishing a relationship between students and teachers.
	* `profesor_id`: A foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `users` table, establishing a relationship between students and teachers.
	* `timestamps`: Two timestamp columns for recording creation and update times.

### Down Method
=============

#### Description
---------------

The `down()` method is responsible for executing the migration's logic when reverting the database schema changes.

#### Functionality
-----------------

The `down()` method performs a single task:

1. Drops the existing `alumno_profesor` table, effectively reverting the changes made in the `up()` method.

By following this documentation, developers should be able to understand the purpose and functionality of this migration, as well as how it affects the underlying database schema.
