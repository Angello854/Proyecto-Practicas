## Introduction
--------------

The `web.php` file is a key part of the Laravel routing configuration, responsible for handling HTTP requests and dispatching them to appropriate controller actions. This documentation provides an overview of the routes configured in this file.

## Routes Configuration
---------------------

### Index Route
---------------

The index route is defined as:

```php
Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index'])->name('welcome');
```

**Purpose:** The purpose of this route is to handle GET requests to the root URL (`/`) and dispatch them to the `index` method of the `HomeController`.

**Parameters:** This route does not accept any parameters.

**Return Values:** The `index` method returns a view or a response that represents the welcome page of the application.

**Functionality:** When a GET request is made to the root URL, this route will dispatch it to the `index` method of the `HomeController`, which is responsible for rendering the welcome page. The `name` attribute specifies the route name as `'welcome'`, making it easier to generate URLs and perform route-related operations.

## Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the `web.php` file plays a crucial role in configuring routes for the application. This documentation provides an overview of the index route, which is responsible for handling GET requests to the root URL and dispatching them to the `index` method of the `HomeController`. Understanding this route configuration is essential for developing and maintaining the application's routing logic.
